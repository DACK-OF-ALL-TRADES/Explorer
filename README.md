## üéØ Deployed App

### [explorer-guide.herokuapp.com](https://explorer-guide.herokuapp.com/) 

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://explorer-guide.herokuapp.com/)
 
## ‚òÄÔ∏è About:
Explorer has been created to help finalize your next travel destination. Finding your dream location has never been so easy... \
You merely need to log in or sign up, create your profile, answer a few questions, and then you are good to go. It happens that at times you like more than one place, to tackle such a situation you also have the option of saving cities of your choice and finalizing a place later from your saved list. \
If this sounds exhausting, then you can also get a randomly generated city where you can plan for a holiday with your near and dear ones.
 
## üìì Description:

* A full stack user-focused `MERN` application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.
* Used a framework that was both easy-to use, but also responsive and optimize for the user‚Äôs experience.
* The app has mainly been styled by using `React Semantic UI` CSS framework and was hosted using `Heroku`.
* The steps were mostly focused on creating a good UI/UX and with the logic of interactions around the page.
* Using `Apollo Client` with GraphQL was also some of our main focused areas.
 
## üîß Usage:
 * Everything is starting from the `Landing Page`, where you can navigate to either the `login` or the `signup` page.
 * Once logged in, the user is presented with the `Home Page`, where they can discover some functionality around the app & navigate to their `Account Page` or simply `Logout`
 * The `Explorer Top 10` cities & selecting a continent could also be navigated through the static side selector.
 * Selecting the `pick an option for me` button will navigate you to the __set of questions__ that will provide suitable results to the user.
 * Selecting a city card would navigate you to a page where you are provided with the __details__ about the city that includes its __location__,  a __video__ quick tour about the area and at the bottom a list of __hotels__ & most **popular attractions** that are available will be present.
 * The user can also view the total number of __daily active COVID-19 cases__ in that country.
 * You can add a city yo your __Favorites__ and view it later.
 * On clicking the `Account page`, the user can update their details and also view the city history of their account.

## üî© Installation:
`Explorer` could also be running in your local computer, however, I wouldn't recommend it since you would be needing an `API KEY` from all the API's there were present. Althought, if attempting to do so, please enter your `API KEY` in a `.env` file and store it under `/client/src` then follow the following.
```env
REACT_APP_API_KEY = <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
REACT_APP_API_KEY_YELP = <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
REACT_APP_API_KEY_MAP = <YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
```
After those steps, simply pull this repository and run;
```bash
npm install
```
on the root of the directory.
> This will install the packages for both the client and the server.
> Also make sure your mongoDB connection is valid since the local program uses data which is stored locally.
> Check with simply `mongod` or `mongo`. 
After installing the dependencies, run;
```bash
npm run dev
```
to start the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Uses a service worker for offline functionality so that the app works as a PWA
3. Add forgot password/reset password as a feature

## üìä Notes & Improvements:

> Creating Explorer was very enjoyable and fun since the mood of the application is based on vacation and travelling, we all acted very cool and stress-free. Although, creating this app was a last minute change in the middle of the **2-week** duration **Final Project Assignment**, we were able to work collaboratively and well organized together as a team.

> Explorer would an awesome place to start and grow this idea of a `traveller's search place` over the time, however, certain functionality could've been added between users between each other to make this idea much more enjoyable through UX.


> We are looking to eventually add more into it however, if you've got unique ideas please let us know, we would love to hear them.
