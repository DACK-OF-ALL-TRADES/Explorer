## 🌲 About:
Explorer is a _MERN stack single-page application_, which has been created to help the user in finalizing a holiday destination. Finding your dream location has never been so easy. You merely need to login or sign up, create your profile, answer a few questions, and then you are good to go. It happens that at times you like more than one place, to tackle such a situation you also have the option of saving cities of your choice and finalizing a place later from your saved list. If this sounds exhausting, then you can also get a randomly generated city where you can plan for a holiday with your near and dear ones.
 
## 📓 Description and Working:
  ## Description
The app has the following features 
* A full stack user-focused MERN application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.
* The app includes user authentication, Routing and API's transfers and a database 
* Built on the agile development methodologies that we have used throughout this course.
 * Instead of using the  HTML, __Reactjs__ is used for displaying the front end version of the app.
 * Used a framework that was both easy-to use, but also responsive and optimize for the user’s experience.
 * Used __Heroku web server__ to host our app.
 * The steps involved in designing mainy dealt with designing thefull stack code and using queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
 
   ## Working
 * You are greeted with a __Landing Page__ from where you can navigate to either the __login__ or the __signup__ page as per your requirement.
 * Once logged in, the user is presented with the __Home Page__ , where he can know more about the app, navigate to his _Profile Page_ or simply _logout_
 * On _top_ of the home page, the user will have the option of exploring the __top 10__ cities around the world that are famous as a travel destination or they can search as per the __continent__ of their choice and selet a place to visit directly.
 * As we scroll down you will reach a __set of questions__ which when __answered__ will provide a __list of cities__ from around the world for you that are most suited for your  perfect holiday.
 * Not only that, once you click on the city of your choice, you are provided with the __details__ about the city that includes its __location__ on the map, __video__ to guide the traveller a bit more about the place, list of __hotels__ that are avaiable in that area to name a few.
 * Given the current scenario, the user can also view the total number of __active COVID cases__ in that area and then decide if they wish to travel to the city or not
 * On clicking the __Profile page__, the user can update his details and also view the cities that he would have saved while conducting the search
 * You can save all the cities that you like as __favorites__ in your __Profile page__ which you can view and edit as required.
