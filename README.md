## 🌲 About:
Explorer is a _MERN stack single-page application_, which has been created to help the user in finalizing a holiday destination. Finding your dream location has never been so easy. You merely need to login or sign up, create your profile, answer a few questions, and then you are good to go. It happens that at times you like more than one place, to tackle such a situation you also have the option of saving cities of your choice and finalizing a place later from your saved list. If this sounds exhausting, then you can also get a randomly generated city where you can plan for a holiday with your near and dear ones.
 
## 📓 Description and Working:
  ## Description
The app has the following features 
* A full stack user-focused MERN application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.
* The app includes user authentication, Routing and API's transfers and a database 
* Built on the agile development methodologies that we have used throughout this course.
 * Instead of using the  HTML, __Reactjs__ is used for displaying the front end version of the app.
 * Used a framework that was both easy-to use, but also responsive and optimize for the user’s experience.
 * Used __Heroku web server__ to host our app.
 * The steps involved in designing mainy dealt with designing thefull stack code and using queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
 
   ## Working
 * You are greeted with a Landing  Page from where you can navigate to either the login or the signup page as per your requirement.
